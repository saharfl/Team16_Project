How to run: For the final version of the project, compile all packages and run the class 'Display' found in the 'view' package. 

Updates on the final version of the project
  - Removed all bugs from random Maze generator(so there is always a path from player to goal)
  - constructed packages 
  -  Clean up each class/junit one-by-one (
      i) get rid of code repetition,
      ii) fix variable names/unused variables,
      iii) consistent spacing/if else design**, 
      iv) remove magic numbers, 
      v) each method performs a single task );
      vi) comment everything using java doc*; 
   - images are declared as final variables 
   - Throw Exception error that do not allow user to enter invalid data and gives user easy to understand/fix error messages
   - Window pop-up at the end of the game(TA recommended) that says ‘play again’ or ‘close
   - Seperated GUI and Logic classes into view and logic packages
   - Can save the current state of the game if game is left unfinished and able to load previously saved data 
   - Exceptions are cascaded on the files appropriately
   - Atleast one class runs all the junit methods
   - Make instance variables private, encapsulate and create accessors/mutators 
   - Implement OO design with polymorhphism and abstract class
